# WordleCalc
Wordle solver

To be used while playing Wordle.  It almost works perfectly fine almost all the time, but misperformo spectularly in a few games for totally unknown (at least to me) reasons.  cf game #433 (answer: RUDER)--the program runs out of possible answers.  Hint:  start with JOINT and PARSE.
